# Solving NP problems problem with variational quantum eigensolver
In this project I used or implemented the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm on several quantum design platforms and tested it on a reduction of an NP-Complete problem (the partitioning problem) to Ising Hamiltonian eigenvalue search. In the report I present the mathematical background of the project, a comparison of the results from the different platforms, approximation method and future work suggestions. 

In addition, I used a chain of reductions to solve a multi agent path finding problem (MAPF) using VQE. Mathematical background and the results can be found in the MAPF folder.
